makefile
alphabetcount.c to count the frequency of alphabet letters; and

The instructor will use the following files to test your code, so please DON'T modify these two files:
testalphabetcount.c
testspecialcount.c
your program must execute correctly on Edoras machine, the instructor/TA will type the following commands to test
your code:
make testalphabet // generate testalphabet executable file
make testspecial // generate testspecial executable file
./testalphabet // run the testalphabet program to count frequency of alphabet letters, the result will be stored in the
file result.txt under result folder
./testspecial
// run the testspecial program to count frequency of the five special words, the result will be stored in
